# Optimization Prompt (Task-Oriented Verification)
OPTIMIZATION_PROMPT="First, read and understand the AGENTS.md file which contains project-specific guidelines, coding conventions, and development practices. 

Then, combine these prompts into a single, task-oriented prompt that will direct you to:

1. Verify the existence of the components described in the prompts within the project codebase
2. If any component does not exist, recreate it following the guidelines from AGENTS.md
3. Ensure all code follows the project's coding conventions and best practices
4. Maintain consistency with the existing project structure and patterns

Base your implementation decisions on the guidance in AGENTS.md, prioritizing:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Adherence to project conventions
- Proper documentation and commenting
- Type safety and error handling"
