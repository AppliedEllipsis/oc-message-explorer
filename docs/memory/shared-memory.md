# Shared Memory Pool

This file serves as a consolidated memory pool that all AI tools (Kilocode, Roocode, Opencode, Amp, Gemini, Claude, Antigravity, etc.) can read from and write to.

## Purpose

The shared memory pool provides:
- **Unified Context**: All tools share the same project understanding
- **Cross-Tool Continuity**: Work started in one tool can be continued in another
- **Consolidated History**: Single source of truth for project state
- **Tool Agnostic**: Works independently of any specific tool's internal memory system

## Working Pattern

### When Starting a Session (Any Tool)

1. **Read Tool Registry** (`docs/memory/tool-registry.md`):
   - Identify which tool you are (Kilocode, Roocode, Opencode, etc.)
   - Find your tool's entry in the registry
   - Understand your tool's role and any special instructions

2. **Read Shared Memory** (`docs/memory/shared-memory.md`):
   - Read recent entries (last 5-10) to understand current state
   - Check "Current Focus" for what was being worked on
   - Review "Pending Tasks" for incomplete work
   - Note any tool-specific context relevant to your work

3. **Read Tool-Specific Documentation** (if exists):
   - Read your tool's design document (e.g., `plans/kilocode-memory-system-design.md`)
   - Understand tool-specific patterns and conventions
   - Adapt your working pattern to the tool's strengths

4. **Read Project Documentation**:
   - Read relevant sections of `AGENTS.md`
   - Read `docs/MEMORY.md` for query history and context
   - Understand project structure and conventions

5. **Report to User**:
   - Confirm context is loaded
   - Summarize what you know about the project
   - List pending tasks with `t{number}` prefix
   - Offer to continue with next task or accept new work

### During Work (Any Tool)

1. **Make Incremental Changes**: Update shared memory as you work, not just at the end
2. **Document Decisions**: Explain why you're making changes, not just what
3. **Sync with Project Docs**: Keep `docs/MEMORY.md` and other docs in sync with shared memory
4. **Track Tool-Specific Notes**: Document tool-specific patterns or issues in tool registry

### When Ending a Session (Any Tool)

1. **Update Shared Memory**:
   - Document work completed
   - Update task statuses
   - Add any new patterns or rules learned
   - Note any incomplete work that should be continued

2. **Sync with Tool-Specific Memory**:
   - If your tool has its own memory system, sync relevant information
   - Cross-reference shared memory entries with tool-specific entries
   - Ensure consistency between systems

3. **Report Completion**:
   - Summarize what was accomplished
   - List any incomplete items
   - Suggest next steps if appropriate

- [ ] Message versioning and comparison

### Configuration Files

**.env** - Environment variables stored here:
- OPENAI_API_KEY - OpenAI API key

## Quick Reference

### Tool Registry Reference

| Tool | Registry Entry | Internal Memory | Special Patterns |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Kilocode | [`tool-registry.md`](./tool-registry.md) | `plans/kilocode-memory-system-design.md` | Automated memory tracking, version logging |
| Roocode | [`tool-registry.md`](./tool-registry.md) | (to be discovered) | (to be documented) |
| Opencode | [`tool-registry.md`](./tool-registry.md) | Uses this shared memory | File operations, web tools |
| Amp | [`tool-registry.md`](./tool-registry.md) | (to be discovered) | (to be documented) |
| Gemini | [`tool-registry.md`](./tool-registry.md) | (to be discovered) | (to be documented) |
| Claude | [`tool-registry.md`](./tool-registry.md) | (to be discovered) | (to be documented) |
| Antigravity | [`tool-registry.md`](./tool-registry.md) | (to be discovered) | (to be documented) |

### Project Context

**Project**: OC Message Explorer - A tool for exploring and analyzing OpenChat messages

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31

**Current Phase**: UI enhancements and feature additions

### Shared Memory Guidelines

**For All Tools**:

1. **Read First, Write Second**: Always read shared memory before making changes
2. **Document Decisions**: Explain why, not just what
3. **Keep It Synced**: Update shared memory as you work, not just at end
4. **Be Concise**: Use clear, brief summaries that other tools can understand
5. **Reference Other Systems**: Cross-reference with tool-specific memory when appropriate

**Sanitization Rules**:
- API keys → `[API_KEY]`
- Personal emails → `[USER_EMAIL]`
- Credentials → `[CREDENTIAL]`
- URLs with sensitive data → `[SENSITIVE_URL]`
- File paths with personal info → `[PERSONAL_PATH]`

**Entry Size Guidelines**:
- Each entry should be concise (100-300 words typically)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use markdown links for file references
- Separate entries clearly with `---`

### Navigation Primitives

**Coherence Wormhole** (Speed Optimization):
- Trigger: When converging on clear target, intermediate steps implied/resolved
- Protocol: Ask "Would you like me to take a coherence wormhole and jump straight there?"
- Safeguard: Only offer when destination stable, skip only if user agrees
- Never skip for verification, auditability, or trust-critical work

**Vector Calibration** (Direction Optimization):
- Trigger: When nearby target Y better aligns with intent (generality, simplicity, leverage, durability)
- Protocol: Ask "Would you like to redirect to Y, briefly compare X vs Y, or stay on X?"
- Safeguard: Only trigger with high confidence, no second-guessing if user stays on X
- One well-timed course correction option

See [`agents.min.md`](../agents.min.md) for complete navigation primitives documentation.

**Quick Reference**: [`agents.min.md`](../agents.min.md) - Optimized quick-start guide (read first for fast onboarding)

### Git Commit Format

This project uses enhanced conventional commit messages with emojis. All tools should follow this format when generating commits.

**Commit Message Format**:
```markdown
~ [ short up to 8 word summary ]:

<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

**Documentation**: [`git_commit_format.md`](./git_commit_format.md) - Complete commit message specification

**Types and Emojis**:
- `feat` ✨ - New feature or functionality
- `fix` 🐛 - Bug fix or error correction
- `docs` 📝 - Documentation changes
- `style` 🎨 - Code style changes
- `refactor` ♻️ - Code refactoring
- `perf` ⚡️ - Performance improvements
- `test` ✅ - Testing changes
- `build` 📦 - Build system changes
- `ci` 🚀 - CI/CD configuration
- `chore` 🔧 - Maintenance tasks
- `revert` ⏪ - Reverting previous commits
- `i18n` 🌐 - Internationalization

**Commit Message Rules**:
- Summary: Maximum 8 words, present tense, capture essence
- Subject: Imperative mood ("add" not "added"), lowercase, max 50 chars
- Body: Bullet points with "-", explain "what" and "why", not "how"
- Breaking Changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` in footer
- Prefix: Always start with `~ [ short up to 8 word summary ]:`

## Integration Notes

### Tool-Specific Considerations

**Kilocode**:
- Has its own automated memory system in `plans/kilocode-memory-system-design.md`
- Should sync completed work to shared memory at end of session
- Can reference shared memory for cross-session continuity

**Roocode**:
- Internal memory system yet to be discovered
- Should create tool registry entry when discovered
- Adapt Kilocode patterns where appropriate

**Opencode**:
- Primary maintainer of this shared memory system
- Uses file operations (read, write, edit, glob, grep)
- Has web tools (webfetch, websearch, codesearch)
- No internal memory system - relies entirely on shared memory
- Should follow [`git_commit_format.md`](./git_commit_format.md) when creating commits

**Amp, Gemini, Claude, Antigravity**:
- Internal memory systems yet to be discovered
- Should create tool registry entries when discovered
- Follow shared memory working pattern

### Conflict Resolution

When multiple tools have conflicting information:

1. **Project Docs Take Precedence**: `docs/MEMORY.md`, `AGENTS.md` are authoritative
2. **Shared Memory Is Reference**: Use shared memory for cross-tool continuity
3. **Tool-Specific Memory Is Supplemental**: Use for tool-specific patterns only
4. **Document Conflicts**: When you find conflicts, document them in shared memory

### Version Control

- `docs/memory/` directory is git-tracked
- All memory files are versioned
- Use commit messages that reference memory updates
- Example: `docs(memory): shared memory - add tool registry entry for Roocode`
