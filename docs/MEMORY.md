## Query History

### [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] - Query: Initialize OC Message Explorer

**Query**: Create OC Message Explorer from project scaffolding template

**Context**: User wants to extract and recreate the scaffolding from another project to use as a template for new projects. Keep environment-specific stuff (test API keys) but remove project-specific references.

**Outcome**: Completed
- Initialized git repository
- Created .gitignore with standard exclusions
- Set up package.json with TypeScript dependencies
- Configured ESLint and commitlint
- Created TypeScript configuration
- Set up .env.example for environment variables
- Created memory system documentation (shared-memory.md, tool-registry.md, git_commit_format.md, README.md)
- Created AGENTS.md and agents.min.md with development guidelines
- Added comprehensive README.md with project documentation
- Updated .env.example with comprehensive template
- All files committed using enhanced conventional commit format

### [2026-01-31 01:00 UTC] - Query: Finalize OC Message Explorer

**Query**: Complete OC Message Explorer setup with README and finalize all configuration

**Context**: After setting up the core files, added comprehensive documentation and README to make OC Message Explorer complete and ready for use.

**Outcome**: Completed
- Added comprehensive README.md with quick start guide
- Documented project structure, features, and AI agent memory system
- Included development workflow and scripts documentation
- Updated .env.example with comprehensive template including API configuration, testing, and monitoring sections
- Confirmed all files committed using enhanced conventional commit format
- Verified clean git status with working tree clean

### [2026-01-31 02:45 UTC] - Query: Enhance message type classification and search visibility

**Query**: Add ability to expand thread messages in search, see AI responses, and distinguish between different prompt types

**Context**: User requested visibility into collapsed threads during search, display of AI responses, and differentiation between manually typed prompts, auto-generated prompts (from pressing up arrow), and system messages.

**Outcome**: Completed
- **Auto-expand search results**: When search finds matching messages, all parent nodes in the thread are automatically expanded to make results visible
- **Enhanced type classification**: Messages now classified as:
  - `user` - Manually typed user prompts (role == "user" and not auto-generated)
  - `auto` - Auto-generated prompts (detected via content patterns like "auto-generated", "previous query", "up arrow", etc.)
  - `system` - System messages (role == "system")
  - `response` - AI assistant responses (role == "assistant")
  - `prompt` - Legacy type for backward compatibility
- **Visual distinction**: Each message type has unique styling:
  - User: Green border, green badge
  - Auto-Generated: Blue dashed border, blue badge
  - System: Gray border, gray badge
  - Response: Yellow border (existing), yellow badge (existing)
- **Updated filters**: User-only filter now includes "user", "auto", and "prompt" types
- **Auto-generated detection**: Pattern matching function added to Go backend with detection for: auto-generated, auto generated, previous query, previous prompt, history, continue, resume, up arrow, ↑, continuation, repeating, recalling
- **Backend changes** (main.go):
  - Added `isAutoGenerated()` function for content pattern detection
  - Updated `loadOpenCodeMetadata()` to classify messages by role and auto-generation status
  - Added proper tags: "auto-generated" tag added to auto messages
- **Frontend changes** (app.js):
  - Added `expandSearchResults()` function to auto-expand parent nodes
  - Updated `applyFilters()` and `getMessagesToDisplay()` to handle new types
- **UI changes** (index.html):
  - Added CSS styles for user-node, system-node, auto-node
  - Added CSS styles for node-type.user, node-type.system, node-type.auto
  - Updated editor type dropdown to include all new types

## Current Focus

### Last Query

**Query**: Finalize OC Message Explorer
**Time**: 2026-01-31 01:00 UTC
**Summary**: OC Message Explorer complete with README and comprehensive documentation

### Context

OC Message Explorer is complete and ready for use. All essential files are in place:

- Git repository initialized with enhanced conventional commit format

- Memory system fully documented
- Development guidelines written (AGENTS.md and agents.min.md)
- Comprehensive README.md added
- Environment variables template provided
- All project-specific content removed from source project

### Planning

Project is now ready for:
1. Use OC Message Explorer to analyze OpenChat messages
2. Add new features in `src/` directory
3. Configure with environment variables
4. Extend functionality as needed

### Remaining Items

- [ ] None - initial setup is complete
